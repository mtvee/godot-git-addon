Git Addon for Godot Engine
==========================

This is a super simple git addon for Godot Engine that handles the basics
of day to day git operations. You will still need a proper git client to do
anything remotely intricate.

This, presently, just handles the following git commands

- status
- commit
- pull
- push

Why?
----

I got annoyed with windows not having a real terminal so I wanted to do 
basic operations from within Godot. That's all :)
